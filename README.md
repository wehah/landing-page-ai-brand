# Landing Page for an AI Brand built with React and Atomic Design Methodology

This project is a landing page for an AI brand designed to showcase innovative AI solutions and drive user engagement. It leverages React.js and Atomic Design principles to create a scalable, maintainable, and visually appealing user interface.

## Key Features
* **Atomic Design System:** The UI is built using Atomic Design, a methodology that breaks down the interface into reusable components organised into hierarchical levels. This approach promotes consistency, efficiency, and easier maintenance as the project evolves.
* **Vite.js Boilerplate:** The project utilises Vite.js, a blazing-fast build tool for modern web development.
* **SASS/SCSS Styling:** Implemented for features like variables, mixins, and nesting, making styles more consistent, organised, and maintainable.

## Development Process
The landing page was developed using an Atomic Design approach. This involved:
1. **Defining Atoms:** Creating the fundamental building blocks such as buttons, typography styles, and form elements.
2. **Building Molecules:** Combining atoms to form more complex UI components like search bars or menu items.
3. **Constructing Organisms:** Assembling molecules into sections of the landing page, such as the hero section (image/video slider).
4. **Creating Layouts:** Combining organisms to form the complete landing page layout (app).

By following this structured approach, the project ensures a scalable and maintainable codebase that can easily adapt to future requirements.
